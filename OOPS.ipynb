        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "   - OOP means writing code by creating our own classes with attributes and functions/methods. It helps us group related data and actions together inside something called an object.\n",
        "   - It makes our code more organized, reusable, and easier to manage.\n",
        "   - It involves:\n",
        "   - Encapsulation - Keeping data and functions in one place\n",
        "   - Abstraction - Showing only what's needed, hiding the rest\n",
        "   - Inheritance - One class can take things from another class\n",
        "   - Polymorphism - Same function name can do different things for different objects.\n",
        "   - In example below, book is a class, author_name, book_name are attributes and read_book function is a method.\n",
        "\n",
        "         Class Book:\n",
        "             def __init__(self, author_name,book_name):\n",
        "                 self.author_name = author_name\n",
        "                 self.book_name = book_name\n",
        "\n",
        "             def read_book(self):\n",
        "                 return f\"Author of the {self.book_name} is {self.author_name}\"\n",
        "\n",
        "            # Creating an object of the Book class\n",
        "             details_book = Book(\"Paulo Coelho\", \"The Alchemist\")\n",
        "             print(details_book.read_book())\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "   - A class is a way of creating our own structure in code that holds both variables and functions. We use it to create objects that behave in a certain way- like what data it will store (called attributes) and what it can do (called methods or functions inside the class).\n",
        "   - It is like blueprint or template used to create objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "   - An object is something we make using a class. It holds real data and can use the functions defined inside the class.\n",
        "   - It has its own values and can do things using the functions of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "             # 'details_book' is an object\n",
        "             details_book = Book(\"Paulo Coelho\", \"The Alchemist\")\n",
        "             print(details_book.read_book())\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "   - Abstraction means we don't show all the details — just the part the user needs.\n",
        "   - Encapsulation means we keep the data and functions together in one place and protect them from outside changes.\n",
        "   - Abstraction:\n",
        "    - Hiding the complex logic, that is, show only what's needed\n",
        "    - Focus is on what the object does\n",
        "    - Done using abstract classes or interfaces\n",
        "    - Done using abstract classes or interfaces\tDone using private variables and methods\n",
        "    - Example: When you use a coffee machine - you press a button (you don't need to know the internal wiring)\n",
        "   - Encapsulation:\n",
        "    - Hiding the data and keeping it safe inside a class\n",
        "    - Keep everything together and protected\n",
        "    - Focus is on how it does it safely\n",
        "    - Done using private variables and methods\n",
        "    - Example: All the coffee machine parts (water, beans, heating) are hidden inside the machine\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "   - Dunder methods are built-in methods in Python with double underscores. We don't call them directly — Python calls them when something happens, like printing or creating an object.\n",
        "   - They are also called magic methods.\n",
        "   - Common examples are __init__, __str__, __len__, etc.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "   - Inheritance is when one class gets the features (methods, variables) of another class, like passing traits from parent to child.\n",
        "   - It is like one class (child) can reuse the code from another class (parent).\n",
        "   - Example below,\n",
        "\n",
        "            # Parent Class\n",
        "             class home:\n",
        "                 def __init__(self, print_colour, decorator_item):\n",
        "                     self.print_colour = print_colour\n",
        "                     self.decorator_item = decorator_item\n",
        "\n",
        "                 def room(self):\n",
        "                     return f\"Room colour would be {self.print_colour} and decorator would be {self.decorator_item}.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "            # Child Class\n",
        "            class apartment(home):\n",
        "                def number_of_romms(self):\n",
        "                    return f\"Room colour would be {self.print_colour} and decorator would be {self.decorator_item} and number of rooms would be 5.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "          house_details = apartment(\"blue\", \"bed_lamp\")\n",
        "          print(house_details.room())\n",
        "          print(house_details.number_of_romms())\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "    - Polymorphism lets us use one method name that works differently for different objects.\n",
        "    - \"Poly\" = many, \"Morph\" = form. So, polymorphism = many forms\n",
        "    - For example: In below example same method \"read_book\" is used in both the class but it gives different outputs — based on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "                class Novel:\n",
        "                    def read_book(self):\n",
        "                        return f\"Novel is good.\"\n",
        "                    \n",
        "                class non_fiction:\n",
        "                    def read_book(self):\n",
        "                        return f\"Non Fiction is good.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "                for x in [Novel(), non_fiction()]:\n",
        "                    print(x.read_book())\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "   - It is achieved in the following ways:\n",
        "     - self.variable = Public (can access from outside)\n",
        "     - _variable = Protected (should not access directly)\n",
        "     - __variable = Private (cannot access directly)\n",
        "                    \n",

        "    - Method Overloading means having multiple methods with the same name, but different number or type of arguments.\n",
        "    - Python doesn't support method overloading directly like Java or C++.\n",
        "    - If we write two methods with the same name, the last one will overwrite the first.\n",
        "    - We use default arguments or *args to simulate overloading.\n",
        "    - If we give a default value to the parameter in the function.So, even if you don't pass anything, it still works.\n",
        "    - For example:\n",
        "    \n",
        "                    def greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n",

        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "    - Method Overriding is a method in a child class with the same name as a method in the parent class, and changing its behavior.\n",
        "    - This allows the child class to provide its own version of the method while keeping the same method name.\n",
        "    - Method Overriding is one way to achieve Polymorphism.\n",
        "    - For example: In below example, the method sound() behaves differently depending on whether it's a Dog or Cat, this is polymorphism. And it was done by overriding the sound() method in both Dog and Cat, this is method overriding.\n",

        "    - Polymorphism means “many forms”.\n",
        "    - This allows same method name to give different results based on the object..\n",
        "    - It's important because it lets one function or method behave differently for different objects — this makes the code more flexible, cleaner, and reusable.\n",
        "    - We don't need to write separate code for each class.\n",
        "    - It's easier to maintain and extend code.\n",
        "    - We just call particular method — Python decides what version to run depending on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "    - An abstract class is like a blueprint.\n",
        "    - It cannot be used directly, but other classes can inherit from it and fill in the details.\n",
        "    - In below example, Shape is like a plan (abstract class) that has a method called area() — but it's empty. Circle and Rectangle are real classes (child classes) that follow this plan and write their own area(). By doing this, we make sure that any class that comes from Shape must have a area() method. This keeps things same and clear across all classes.\n",
        "                      \n",
